Nanavati returns home from the line of duty, only to find that his wife Sylvia Nanavati is having an extra-marital affair with the businessman & socialite Prem Ahuja. Jealousy and anger lead to an unexpected encounter where Nanavati fires three shots from his service gun. Was this an Honor killing or murder? This sparks a nationwide debate. On one hand, the people, media, and government debate moralities of Sylvia & Prem to establish Nanavati as a national hero. On the other hand, Parsis and Sindhis stand against each other in a war to save their community’s pride or convict a murderer. Witness the complete truth of the last and most controversial jury trial in India-the case that divided India. Binge on!",
